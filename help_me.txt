# Basic navigation commands

cd - change directory (e.x. cd path/to/file)
mkdir - make directory (e.x. mkdir nameofdir)
ls - show files in current directory

# Git commands

git status - shows what files are being tracked/untracked,
	     always use this before adding files so that 
	     you can know which files to add into the commit

git add <file> - this is how you track the changes you've 
		 made

git stash save "<message>" - this will save all of your changes
			     into a 'stash' and revert your local
			     code to it's previous state

git commit -m "<message>" - this packages all the files you
			    have changed into one group to 
			    be pushed to GitHub together

git push origin master - this is the command that will push your
			 commit onto GitHub

git pull origin master - this is how you update your code so that
			 it matches the changes made on GitHub

####
Important Notes:

1) ALWAYS check GitHub before you push code:
	-Do this to check if anyone has pushed any code while you've been
working.
	-If your code is up to date with the latest push (i.e. you did a pull)
don't worry
	-If it is not up to date with the latest push, and the files changed
are the same files you are editing, do this:
		1) git stash save "<your message>"
		2) git pull origin master
		3) git stash list
		4) git stash pop <stash@{x}> - whichever one is the one you
saved
		5) git add <files>
		6) git commit -m "<your message>"
		7) git push origin master
